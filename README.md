Start of building my companies website
Hello,
My name is Matt Dill and I am starting the journey of building my bosses website for him for free. I have been involved in learning computer science now for the last couple years as hobby. I started cs50 this year and feel that my learning as tripled. I also have completed several languages on codecademy.com. Anyways any help would be greatly appreciated \
